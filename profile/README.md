Introduction

Storage on Solana is designed to offer a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud storage services. By leveraging the Solana blockchain, the app ensures that files are stored securely and can be accessed and shared with ease.
Features

    Decentralized Storage: Files are stored on the Solana blockchain, providing enhanced security and data integrity.
    File Upload: Users can upload files directly from their devices to the blockchain.
    File Sharing: Securely share files with others through generated links.
    User Authentication: Utilizes Solana wallets for user authentication and file management.

Architecture

The application is built using the following components:

    Frontend: A React.js web application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
    Backend: Node.js server that handles interactions with the Solana blockchain and manages file uploads and retrievals.
    Blockchain: Solana Devnet is used for storing file metadata and ensuring decentralized file management.

How it Works

    User Authentication: Users connect their Solana wallet to the app to authenticate.
    File Upload: Users select files to upload. The files are then processed and stored on the Solana blockchain.
    Metadata Storage: File metadata, including the file's hash and storage location, is stored on the Solana blockchain.
    File Sharing: Users can generate secure links to share their files. Recipients can use these links to access the files.
